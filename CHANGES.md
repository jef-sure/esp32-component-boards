# CHANGES

## 0.0.1 (2026-10-27)

The first release: boards as data, one choice, the glue generated and
committed, a program that asks by kind.

- Four boards and one module: Guition JC1060P470 (7-inch, ESP32-P4),
  JC8012P4A1C (10.1-inch, ESP32-P4), JC4827W543 (4.3-inch, ESP32-S3), the CYD
  (ESP32-2432S028R), and a 2004 character LCD on a PCF8574 backpack as a
  module on any board's I2C bus. Their buses, devices, touch calibrations
  (measured on the Guition boards; a placeholder on the CYD, marked so),
  buttons and `sdkconfig.defaults` with the reasons in comments.
- `boards-data/<board>/board.json` is the only source of truth.
  `tools/boards_gen.py --all` makes from it the C glue, `board.cmake`,
  `boards/boards.cmake`, the `Kconfig`, the dependencies of
  `idf_component.yml` and the tables of the READMEs; `tools/check_boards.py`
  fails when any of them differs from the data.
- The contract of `boards.h` holds at link on every board: the glue defines
  every function, those for parts the board has not answer `false`.
- `board_display_orientation` turns the display and keeps the size as it lies;
  `board_character_display_init` for an HD44780 on the board or as a module;
  `board_touch_firmware` as the hook a program defines to give the GSL3680 its
  firmware; `board_sound_source` to change the source of the sound.
- The CYD as it is: the XPT2046 touch on its own SPI3 (pins 25, 32, 39, cs 33,
  irq 36) through `atanisoft/esp_lcd_touch_xpt2046`, the speaker on the DAC at
  GPIO 26 fed by DMA (`dac_continuous`, which ESP-IDF 6 still has), the BOOT
  button, the SD pins kept as data since no SPI host is left for them. The
  display lies landscape, 320x240.
- The board is chosen once: `tools/board_select.py` puts the board's
  `sdkconfig.defaults` into the project as `sdkconfig.defaults.board`, with
  `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET` and `CONFIG_BOARD_SELECT_<BOARD>=y` as its first lines,
  and the menu follows. Modules are appended with `--module`.
- `tools/board_pins.py`: the map of a board's pins (GPIO to owner, conflicts)
  and its tree; the same checks run in `check_boards.py`.
- `tools/check_boards.py --host-syntax`: every glue compiled on the host
  against `test/fake/` with `-Werror`.
- CI: `examples/hello_board` built for every board, and once with the module,
  under ESP-IDF 5.5 and 6.1.
- Documentation in English and Russian: `docs/en/`, `docs/ru/`, `README.ru.md`.
- The editor of the data (Vue + Pinia from a CDN, no build step) follows the
  format: the `measured` flag of a calibration, a DAC sound without an
  amplifier pin, the touch component with its namespace.

Known: the CYD's touch calibration is a placeholder until measured on a
board; the GSL3680 firmware of the 10.1-inch board is the program's to embed.
